# Cluster Analysis
### Cluster Analysis


We will be looking at some class motivation data collected from this class two years ago. You will be expected to cluster and visualize the clusters. This project is structured in three parts, in the first part you can just follow along with the code, in the second part you will need to apply the code and in the third part is completely freestyle, apply your new knowledge in a new way.
